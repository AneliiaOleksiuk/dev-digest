# INSIGHTS — client

Accumulated engineering knowledge for this package: what worked, what didn't,
codebase-specific patterns, tool quirks, and open questions — kept OUT of
[CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) under the ≤100-line / map-not-documentation rule.

Read at the start of every session per CLAUDE.md, and updated at the end via
the `engineering-insights` skill — treat entries here as high-confidence
guidance unless CLAUDE.md says otherwise. Append-only; entries must pass the
"cold read" test (actionable without re-investigation) — see
[../.claude/skills/engineering-insights/SKILL.md](../.claude/skills/engineering-insights/SKILL.md).

## What Works

- **Formatting tiny/variable-magnitude USD costs**: `${Number(usd.toPrecision(2))}`
  (see `client/src/helpers/format.ts` `formatCost`) renders `$0.06`,
  `$0.014`, `$0.0013` correctly with no trailing zeros, instead of
  `.toFixed(2)` which rounds anything under a cent to `$0.00`. `null`/
  `undefined` must map to `"—"`, not `"$0.00"` — a run without usage data
  (failed/running/cancelled) should read as "no data", not "free".

## What Doesn't Work

## Codebase Patterns

- **`SeverityBadge` (`src/vendor/ui/primitives/Badge.tsx`) already accepts a
  `count` prop** — before building a new component for any "N findings by
  severity" UI (a PR-list column, a run-timeline line, a stat tile), reuse
  `<SeverityBadge severity="CRITICAL" count={n} compact />` per non-zero
  severity rather than inventing a bespoke icon+count element. It was
  previously only ever used per-finding (`FindingCard.tsx`, no `count`
  prop passed) — passing `count` and reusing it for aggregates just works.

## Session Notes

- 2026-07-29: Run Cost Badge feature — added `client/src/helpers/format.ts`
  (`formatCost`, shared across 3 screens), a COST stat tile in
  `RunTraceDrawer/TraceBody`, a tokens+cost line in `RunHistory`'s
  timeline (always rendered, collapses to `"—"` when no data), and a new
  COST column in the PR list (`constants.ts`/`PRRow.tsx`/`styles.ts`).
- 2026-07-30: Findings counter (L01) — same 2-screen pattern as the cost
  badge: a FINDINGS column in the PR list (`PRRow.tsx`/`constants.ts`/
  `styles.ts`, `SeverityBadge` per non-zero severity) and per-severity
  badges replacing the plain-text findings line in `RunHistory.tsx`'s
  timeline. Removed the dead `PrRowView` type from `src/lib/types.ts` — it
  anticipated this exact `{CRITICAL,WARNING,SUGGESTION}` shape but was
  unused; the real fields now live directly on `PrMeta`.
