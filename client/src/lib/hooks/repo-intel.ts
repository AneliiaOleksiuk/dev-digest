    While `poll` is true, refetch on an interval so a running resync's result
    becomes visible. The caller owns when to stop polling (the status enum is
    terminal-only, so completion is detected by watching `lastIndexedSha`/
    `updatedAt` advance, not by status).

    First real consumer (SPEC-01 amendment, WI10): `ResyncBlockedNotice`
    (`app/repos/[repoId]/context/_components/ProjectContextView/_components/
    ResyncBlockedNotice`) reads `reason` here to render a blocked-resync
    refusal (AC-52) — it does NOT pass `poll: true` (no long-running resync
    to watch; it just reads the persisted state and offers a manual
    "Check again" via `useResyncRepoIntel` below). This comment used to say
    a `ProjectContextView` consumer didn't exist yet; that was doubly stale
    by the time it was written (client/INSIGHTS.md) — it's now accurate. */
